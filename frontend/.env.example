# Copy to .env.local and edit as needed. Used by Vite (npm run dev and build).

# --- LOCALHOST (default for npm run dev) ---
# No vars needed: frontend uses http://localhost:5000. Start backend with: cd backend && npm start

# --- Use LIVE backend from local frontend (optional) ---
# Uncomment to see and edit the same data as the live website (candidates, resumes, etc. from localhost):
# VITE_USE_LIVE_BACKEND=true
# VITE_API_URL=https://skillnix-backend.onrender.com
# When this is on, the header shows "Live" so you know you're touching the live database. Keep default (no vars) for local-only testing.

# --- PRODUCTION BUILD (e.g. deploy to Render) ---
# Set when building the frontend so the deployed site talks to your backend:
# VITE_API_URL=https://skillnix-backend.onrender.com
# (If not set, production build uses https://skillnix-backend.onrender.com by default.)
